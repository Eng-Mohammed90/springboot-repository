Deployment Notes – Assignment 3

Project Overview:
- Backend Framework: Java Spring Boot
- Database: MySQL
- Containerization: Docker
- Deployment Platform: Railway
- Source Code: https://github.com/Eng-Mohammed90/Students-System.git

This assignment focuses on deploying the project to a production environment.
Compared to Assignment #2, the Docker image was improved and successfully connected to the database.

Challenges Faced

1. Database Connection Failure in Previous Docker Image
In Assignment #2, the Docker image was incomplete and failed to establish a connection with the MySQL database.
This caused the application to fail at runtime.

Solution
The Docker configuration was reviewed and corrected.
The application was rebuilt using a proper Dockerfile and correct database dependencies, resulting in a working container that successfully connects to MySQL.

----------------------------------------------------
2. Connecting MySQL Database on Railway
One of the main challenges was linking the MySQL database service provided by Railway with the Spring Boot application.
Initially, the application failed to connect due to incorrect database host, port, and credentials.

**Solution:**
- Created a MySQL service on Railway.
- Retrieved database connection details from the Railway dashboard.
- Configured the following environment variables in Railway:
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`
  - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`
- Updated the application to read database configuration from environment variables instead of hardcoded values.

----------------------------------------------------
3. Environment Variables Configuration
The application was initially using `application.properties` with fixed values, which did not work in production.

Solution:
Modified the configuration to use environment variables, allowing the application to run correctly in the Railway production environment.
